            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHEREAS a certain Printed Paper, entituled, <hi>An Humble Repreſentation of the State of our Woollen-Manufacture,</hi> has been induſtriouſly handed about, in favour of the <hi>Hamburgh-Company;</hi> we ſhall, in the firſt place, moſt readily concurr with the Repreſenter, in the following Propoſals, <hi>(viz.)</hi>

            <p>Theſe, and all other wholſom Regulations of the like nature, we deſire may be eſtabliſh'd as the Wiſdom of the Parliament ſhall think meet. But (with Submiſſion) if the Exportation of our Woollen-Manufacture be not Free, and the ſame render'd as cheap as poſſible to Foreign Markets, all our Regulations will ſail in their effect.

            <p>Whilſt the Trade was limited to the <hi>Hamburgh Company</hi> only, there were ſeveral Woollen-Manufactures actually ſet up at <hi>Liege, Viviers, Cologne, Sileſia,</hi> &amp;c. which, during the time of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, and all other wholſom Regulations of the like nature, we deſire may be eſtabliſh'd as the Wiſdom of the Parliament ſhall think meet. But (with Submiſſion) if the Exportation of our Woollen-Manufacture be not Free, and the ſame render'd as cheap as poſſible to Foreign Markets, all our Regulations will fail in their effect. Now the <hi>Hamburgh-Company</hi> has been the Cauſe of rendring our Manufactures dear to Foreign Markets, (as we ſhall immediately prove) and yet theſe are the Men for whom the Repreſenter ſo earneſtly pleads, under the Name of <hi>the Merchant-Adventurers of England;</hi> and therefore we ſuſpect his Deſign is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice our Trade, or that he has no Deſign at all: For he forgets himſelf, and the Cauſe he pleads, when he ſays, <hi>The having but one Seller of Alum, ſavours of a Monoply,</hi> and ſo juſtly ſpeaks againſt Monopolies: And ſo do we, and therefore againſt the <hi>Hamburgh-Company,</hi> becauſe that has been, and would be (if encouraged) the greateſt Monopoly that has been known.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Trade was limited to the <hi>Hamburgh Company</hi> only, there were ſeveral Woollen-Manufactures actually ſet up at <hi>Liege, Viviers, Cologne, Sileſia,</hi> &amp;c. which, during the time of a Free Trade, have been much diſcouraged, and many of them laid down again: which ſufficiently Anſwers what the Repreſenter would fain have the World believe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the <hi>Hamburgh-Company</hi> is the Guardian of our Woollen-Manufacture. And to Anſwer his other Chimera's would be needleſs and troubleſom,
<q>We now proceed to give our REASONS againſt the preſent, or any other <hi>Hamburgh-Company.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Hamburgh-Company</hi> is the moſt unneceſſary of any Company yet known; for that <hi>Hamburgh</hi> is ſo near Home, and has been always ſo much at <hi>England</hi>'s devotion, that that Trade may be eaſily managed without being at the Charge of a <hi>Hamburgh-Company,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Charge to ſupport the <hi>Company</hi> is altogether needleſs. And though it may be ſaid, That the <hi>Company</hi> raiſeth that Charge amongſt themſelves; yet 'tis evident, that their Members muſt have it again out of our Manufactures, ſo they will be ſold the dearer at Foreign Markets, which will very much prejudice the Cloathing Trade here, and occaſion the erecting again of other Manufacturies Abroad. And whereas the <hi>Company</hi> ſo much extoll their Privileges and Immunities, which they pretend to have both at Home and Abroad; we know of none they have at Home but this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That one not Free of that <hi>Company,</hi> pays, by virtue of a Patent granted by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. to a certain Dutcheſs, for a long Weſtern Cloth White, upon Exportation, 5 <hi>s. per</hi> Cloth; whereas one that is Free pays but 1 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d. per</hi> Cloth, over and above the King's Duty: Which looks rather like a Diſcouragement to our Manufacture, than
<pb facs="tcp:171240:3"/>a due Immunity of the <hi>Hamburgh-Company.</hi> And as to their Privileges and Immunities Abroad, whatever they be, they are ſuch as will not countervail the Charges they muſt raiſe amongſt themſelves, and by this they render our Manufactures ſtill dearer to Foreign Markets.</p>
            <p>But we preſume, no body does grudge or envy them for their Immunities; they may ſit quiet in the enjoyment of them. If we have but a Free Trade, we are contented: And (with Submiſſion) a Free Trade in our Woollen-Manufacture is what <hi>England</hi> is chiefly to conſider, and not thoſe trifling and petty Immunities of the <hi>Hamburgh-Company</hi> Abroad, from which <hi>England</hi> reaps no Benefit.</p>
            <p>Experience has ſhewn, That a Free and Unreſtrained Trade is moſt beneficial to our Woollen-Manufactures: For in the three ſucceeding Years after Paſſing the Act 1 <hi>W. M. for a Free Trade,</hi> there was bought, and actually Exported (though in a time of War) to <hi>Holland, Flanders, Brabant</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> of our Woollen-Manufactures, to the value of 400000 <hi>l.</hi> and upwards, from the Port of <hi>London</hi> only, more than was Exported in the three Years preceeding the ſaid Act, when the Trade was limited to the <hi>Hamburgh-Company</hi> only; as may appear by the Entires in the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> Books, relation being had thereunto.</p>
            <p>A limited Sett of Men will buy but when they pleaſe; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="iii."/> but when the Trade is Free, there will be conſtant Buyings. Experience has evidenced this: For when the Trade was confin'd to the <hi>Hamburgh-Company,</hi> they allow'd but two Exportations in the Year, to the end the wealthy Merchants might make their advantage of the poorer ſort of Cloathiers, who not having ſufficient Stocks to keep their Goods from one time of ſhipping to another, were often neceſſitated to ſell for great Loſs, to the Ruine of their Families, and many Poor which they employ'd. But ſince the Trade has been Free, the number of Buyers are much encreaſed, and thereby our Manufactures conſtantly in good demand; every Cloathier expoſing his Cloth to Sale in the Market, may every Week have ſeveral Chapmen, and ſell for Ready-Money, and at better Prices than were ever known when the Trade was confin'd to the <hi>Hamburgh-Company</hi> only. And a Free Trade is evidently the chief, if not the only Reaſon, that Wooll has yielded ſuch good Prices for many Years paſt, having generally ſold for above one Third part more than it did when the Trade was limited as aforeſaid. And ſince a Free Trade has been granted, all the Chief Trading Towns in <hi>Germany</hi> have been ſo plentifully ſupplied with our Manufactures at the beſt hand, that the Foreign Woollen-Manufactures have been much diſcouraged, and the wearing of ours, grows daily more in eſteem.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> never could nor would be prevail'd upon (notwithſtanding the pretended ſtockt Ware houſes of the <hi>Hamburgh-Company</hi> at <hi>Hamburgh</hi>) to make ſome hundred Miles Journeys thither to buy our Manufactures, but would be provided, from time to time, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own Patterns, from <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially when thus they could have them above 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> cheaper; and if they could not have them directly from <hi>England,</hi> they would provide themſelves elſewhere; which very much tended to the obſtruction of the Sale of our Woollen-Manufactures, and the erecting of Woollen-Manufactures in Foreign Parts.</p>
            <q>'Tis true, <hi>the</hi> Hamburgh-Company <hi>offer to admit any of His Majeſty's Natural born Subjects into their Society, for ſuch a Fine as ſhall be thought reaſonable.</hi>

            <p>But this we take to be an Enſnaring Invitation, for that no body can be admitted without taking an Oath to obey their By Laws, now made, or to be made; and all Perſons have not Latitude enough to bind themſelves by ſuch an Oath; the <hi>Company</hi> not declaring what thoſe By-Laws are, or ſhall be hereafter: Which By-Laws will appear to be made for the private Advantage of ſome few Merchants at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> who arbitrarily make and alter them at pleaſure. And a further Danger doth ariſe from the great Debts owing by that <hi>Company,</hi> to which every Perſon that ſhall be admitted will become liable.</p>
            <p>From all theſe Conſiderations, 'tis humbly hoped, that the Wiſdom of Parliament (as the only true Guardian of our Woollen-Manufactures) will not admit any thing to paſs into an Act, to the ſo great prejudice of our Manufacture; but keep it at leaſt in its preſent Freedom, if a further Encouragement ſhall not be thought Convenient.</p>
